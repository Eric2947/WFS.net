# Wavefrontshaping.net examples

Resources from the wavefrontshaping.net [tutorials](http://wavefrontshaping.net/index.php/tutorials).


## General 
* **semidefinite_TM_example.ipynb** Example of the usage of the [semidefinite programming approach](http://wavefrontshaping.net/index.php/component/content/article/63-community/tutorials/phase-measurement/158-semidefinite-programming-for-intensity-only-estimation-of-the-transmission-matrix) for the estimation of the transmission matrix from intensity only measurements.

## Multimode fibers

* **compare_bending_methods.ipynb** Example for [pyMMF](https://github.com/wavefrontshaping/pyMMF). Compare the two bending methods as explained [here](http://wavefrontshaping.net/index.php/component/content/article/68-community/tutorials/multimode-fibers/149-multimode-fiber-modes-part-2).
